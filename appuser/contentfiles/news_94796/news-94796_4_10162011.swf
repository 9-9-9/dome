&al1description2=Gérard Seghers (on 1591 - 1651), painter of Antwerpen by big religious paintings, was subordinated for such a long time by the history to his illustrious contemporary Pierre-Paul Rubens (on 1577 - 1640). We can find tracks of the rubenian art in the painting of Seghers but no more than at the other antwerpers painters of the same generation The art of Gérard Seghers thinks in the other problems. The title of this exhibition shows well the questioning lifted by Seghers. Flemish painter, he made very early his journey in Rome (on 1611 - 1620), and in his return of Rome tried to impose this new art based on the art of the Caravaggio and called caravagisme. But instead of reproducing this Roman art in Antwerp, Seghers tried - and often succeeds - to mix him in the Flemish art of his time. for more info http://Artdaily.org&
